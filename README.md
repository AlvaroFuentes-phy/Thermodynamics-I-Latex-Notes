# Thermodynamics-I-Latex-Notes

Lecture notes for the **first semester** of the Thermodynamics course at UCO (University of Córdoba). Typeset in **LaTeX**. 

> **Note**: This compendium covers the foundational principles of Thermodynamics. Advanced topics such as chemical potential, phase equilibrium, and statistical thermodynamics are addressed in the second semester within the **Thermodynamics II** course.

Each chapter is prefaced with an image from NASA's 'Astronomy Picture of the Day' (APOD) project. These images are used for educational purposes, and authorship belongs to the photographers and institutions credited by NASA in each case.

# Contents (First Semester)
The PDF document focuses on the macroscopic laws of equilibrium and energy:

1. **Introduction to Thermodynamics and Previous Concepts**. Systems, variables, and the different formalisms (Clausius-Kelvin, Carathéodory, MTE).
2. **The Zeroth Law and Temperature**. Thermodynamic interactions and the physical basis for temperature scales.
3. **The First Law of Thermodynamics**. Rigorous derivation of work ($W$), internal energy ($U$), and heat ($Q$).
4. **Equations of State**. Study of real and ideal gases through thermodynamic coefficients and polytropic processes.
5. **The Second Law and Heat Engines**. Analysis of efficiency and the physical roots of irreversibility.
6. **The Carnot Cycle and Entropy**. Definition of Entropy ($S$) as a state function and the foundation of the arrow of time.
