# Thermodynamics-I-Latex-Notes

Lecture notes for the **first semester** of the Thermodynamics course at UCO (University of Córdoba). Typeset in **LaTeX**. 

> **Note**: This compendium covers the foundational principles of Classical Thermodynamics. Advanced topics—such as chemical potential, phase equilibrium, and multi-component systems—are addressed in the second semester within the **Thermodynamics II** course. Furthermore, the microscopic and probabilistic foundations of these phenomena are explored in depth during the third year in the **Statistical Physics** course.

# Contents (First Semester)
The PDF document focuses on the macroscopic laws of equilibrium and energy:

1. **Introduction to Thermodynamics and Previous Concepts**. Systems, variables, and the different formalisms (Clausius-Kelvin, Carathéodory, MTE).
2. **The Zeroth Law and Temperature**. Thermodynamic interactions and the physical basis for temperature scales.
3. **The First Law of Thermodynamics**. Rigorous derivation of work ($W$), internal energy ($U$), and heat ($Q$).
4. **Equations of State**. Study of real and ideal gases through thermodynamic coefficients and polytropic processes.
5. **The Second Law and Heat Engines**. Analysis of efficiency and the physical roots of irreversibility.
6. **The Carnot Cycle and Entropy**. Definition of Entropy ($S$) as a state function and the foundation of the arrow of time.

"Chapters 5 and 6 feature original thermodynamic diagrams of heat engines, providing a rigorous visual representation of thermal cycles and their industrial applications."
